# Fedora / CentOS build guide

(updated for Fedora 31)

## Preparation

Minimal build requirements:

```bash
sudo dnf install boost-devel cmake gcc-c++ git libevent-devel miniupnpc-devel ninja-build openssl-devel python3 zeromq-devel help2man
```

You can do without the `miniupnpc-devel`, `zeromq-devel`, and `help2man`
packages, then you just need to respectively pass `-DENABLE_UPNP=OFF`,
`-DBUILD_BITCOIN_ZMQ=OFF`, or `-DENABLE_MAN=OFF` on the `cmake` command line.

BerkeleyDB 5.3 or later is required for the wallet. This can be installed with:

```bash
    sudo dnf install libdb-cxx-devel libdb-devel
```

If you also want to build the GUI client `bitcoin-qt` Qt 5 is necessary.
To build with Qt 5 you need the following packages installed:

```bash
    sudo dnf install qt5-qttools-devel qt5-qtbase-devel protobuf-devel qrencode-devel
```

You can do without the `qrencode-devel` package, just pass `-DENABLE_QRCODE=OFF`
on the cmake command line.

## Building Radiant Node

Once you have installed the required dependencies (see sections above), you can
build Radiant Node as such:

First fetch the code (if you haven't done so already).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radiantblockchain/radiant-node.git
```

Change to the BCN directory, make `build` dir, and change to that directory

```bash
cd radiant-node/
mkdir build
cd build
```

Next you need to choose between building just the node, the node with wallet
support, or the node and the QT client.

**Choose one:**

```bash
# to build just the node, no wallet functionality, choose this:
cmake -GNinja .. -DBUILD_RADIANT_WALLET=OFF -DBUILD_RADIANT_QT=OFF
```

```bash
# to build the node, with wallet functionality, but without GUI, choose this:
cmake -GNinja .. -DBUILD_RADIANT_QT=OFF
```

```bash
# to build node and QT GUI client, choose this:
cmake -GNinja ..
```

Next, finish the build

```bash
ninja
```

You will find the `radiantd`, `radiant-cli`, `radiant-tx` (and optionally `radiant-qt`)
binaries in `/build/src/(qt)`.

Optionally, run the tests

```bash
ninja check # recommended
```

After a successful test you can install the newly built binaries to your `bin` directory.
Note that this will probably overwrite any previous version installed, including
binaries from different sources.

```bash
sudo ninja install #optional
```
