Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)
====================================

This page describes the implementation status of [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/README.mediawiki)
in Radiant Node. See [BIP2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki)
for basic information about BIPs.

Note that BIPs are written for Bitcoin (Core) rather than for Radiant Node. See
[Radiant Node upgrades](rad-upgrades.md) for implementation status of proposals
specifically written for Radiant Node.

Obsolete BIPs
-------------

We list a BIP as obsolete if:

* the BIP was previously implemented in Radiant Node but the implementation
  was removed later, or;
* the BIP has been replaced with a [Radiant Node upgrade](rad-upgrades.md) that
  is implemented in Radiant Node.

Here, Radiant Node includes its predecessors Bitcoin ABC (before [v0.21.0](release-notes/release-notes-0.21.0.md))
and Bitcoin Core (before [v0.14.1](release-notes/release-notes-0.14.1.md)).
