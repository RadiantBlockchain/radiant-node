Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)
====================================

This page describes the implementation status of [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/README.mediawiki) in Bitcoin Cash Node. See [BIP2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki) for basic information about BIPs.

Note that BIPs are written for Bitcoin (Core) rather than for Bitcoin Cash. See [Bitcoin Cash upgrades](bch-upgrades.md) for implementation status of proposals specifically written for Bitcoin Cash.

Obsolete BIPs
-------------

We list a BIP as obsolete if:

* the BIP was previously implemented in Bitcoin Cash Node but the implementation was removed later, or;
* the BIP has been replaced with a [Bitcoin Cash upgrade](bch-upgrades.md) that is implemented in Bitcoin Cash Node.

Here, Bitcoin Cash Node includes its predecessors Bitcoin ABC (before [v0.21.0](release-notes/release-notes-0.21.0.md)) and Bitcoin Core (before [v0.14.1](release-notes/release-notes-0.14.1.md)).

The preferred address format can be selected with the `-usecashaddr` option.
