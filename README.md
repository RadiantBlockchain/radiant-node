Radiant Node
=================

The goal of Radiant Node is to create sound money that is usable by everyone
in the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will
dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project
aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and
protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many
orders of magnitude beyond current limits.

What is Radiant?
---------------------

Radiant is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone,
anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no
central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out
collectively by the network. Radiant is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became
a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two
split on August 1, 2017. Radiant and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin
share the same transaction history up until the split.

What is Radiant Node?
--------------------------

[Radiant Node](https://www.radiantblockchain.org) is the name of open-source
software which enables the use of Radiant. It is a descendant of the
[Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) and [Bitcoin ABC](https://www.bitcoinabc.org)
software projects.
