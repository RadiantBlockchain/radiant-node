# This program validates that a Python implementation of the ASERT algorithm
# produces identical outputs to test vectors generated from the C++
# implementation in pow.cpp.
#
# The test vectors must be in 'run*' text files in the current directory.
# These run files are produced by the gen_asert_test_vectors program
# which can be built using the Makefile in this folder (you will first
# need to do a build of RADN itself. See the description in the Makefile.
#
# If arguments are given, they must be the names of run* files in the
# current directory.
# If no arguments are given, the list of run* files is determined by
# inspecting the current directory and all such files are processed.
