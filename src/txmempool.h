/**
 * CTxMemPool stores valid-according-to-the-current-best-chain transactions that
 * may be included in the next block.
 *
 * Transactions are added when they are seen on the network (or created by the
 * local node), but not all transactions seen are added to the pool. For
 * example, the following new transactions will not be added to the mempool:
 * - a transaction which doesn't meet the minimum fee requirements.
 * - a new transaction that double-spends an input of a transaction already in
 * the pool.
 * - a non-standard transaction.
 *
 * CTxMemPool::mapTx, and CTxMemPoolEntry bookkeeping:
 *
 * mapTx is a boost::multi_index that sorts the mempool on 3 criteria:
 * - transaction hash
 * - time in mempool
 * - entry id (this is a topological index)
 *
 * Note: the term "descendant" refers to in-mempool transactions that depend on
 * this one, while "ancestor" refers to in-mempool transactions that a given
 * transaction depends on.
 *
 * When a new transaction is added to the mempool, it has no in-mempool children
 * (because any such children would be an orphan). So in addUnchecked(), we:
 * - update a new entry's setMemPoolParents to include all in-mempool parents
 * - update the new entry's direct parents to include the new tx as a child
 *
 * When a transaction is removed from the mempool, we must:
 * - update all in-mempool parents to not track the tx in setMemPoolChildren
 * - update all in-mempool children to not include it as a parent
 *
 * These happen in UpdateForRemoveFromMempool(). (Note that when removing a
 * transaction along with its descendants, we must calculate that set of
 * transactions to be removed before doing the removal, or else the mempool can
 * be in an inconsistent state where it's impossible to walk the ancestors of a
 * transaction.)
 *
 * In the event of a reorg, the invariant that all newly-added tx's have no
 * in-mempool children must be maintained.  On top of this, we use a topological
 * index (GetEntryId).  As such, we always dump mempool tx's into a
 * disconnect pool on reorg, and simply add them one by one, along with tx's from
 * disconnected blocks, when the reorg is complete.
 *
 * Computational limits:
 *
 * Updating of all in-mempool ancestors does not occur anymore in this codebase
 * after the May 15th 2021 network upgrade.  As such, there is no bound on how
 * many in-mempool ancestors of a tx there may be.

     * This mutex needs to be locked when accessing `mapTx` or other members

     *
     * @par Consistency guarantees
     *
     * By design, it is guaranteed that:
     *
     * 1. Locking both `cs_main` and `mempool.cs` will give a view of mempool
     *    that is consistent with current chain tip (`::ChainActive()` and
     *    `pcoinsTip`) and is fully populated. Fully populated means that if the
     *    current active chain is missing transactions that were present in a
     *    previously active chain, all the missing transactions will have been
     *    re-added to the mempool and should be present if they meet size and
     *    consistency constraints.
     *
     * 2. Locking `mempool.cs` without `cs_main` will give a view of a mempool
     *    consistent with some chain that was active since `cs_main` was last
     *    locked, and that is fully populated as described above. It is ok for
     *    code that only needs to query or remove transactions from the mempool
     *    to lock just `mempool.cs` without `cs_main`.
     *
     * To provide these guarantees, it is necessary to lock both `cs_main` and
     * `mempool.cs` whenever adding transactions to the mempool and whenever
     * changing the chain tip. It's necessary to keep both mutexes locked until
     * the mempool is consistent with the new chain tip and fully populated.
     *
     * @par Consistency bug
     *
     * The second guarantee above is not currently enforced, but
     * https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14193 will fix it. No known code
     * in bitcoin currently depends on second guarantee, but it is important to
     * fix for third party code that needs be able to frequently poll the
     * mempool without locking `cs_main` and without encountering missing
     * transactions during reorgs.
